          Using real historical data retreived from Yahoo's finance API, I created a python notebook containing formulas
          and functions to model and forecast future prices of a stock- in this example it's 'PG'.
          We calculated the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the logarithmic returns to create an array of
          drift values- and then used normal distribution to generate a random array of 1,000 daily returns over 10
          different iterations. The results were then placed in a price list array and subsequently plotted on a chart.

          Using the pandas plugin I was able to import housing market data from a .xlxs spreadsheet. The data included
          house prices, square footage, number of rooms, and year built. At first I ran a regression with all three on
          the x-axis and pricing on the y-axis, and then out of curiosity ran the same regression sans number of rooms-
          as the number of rooms and square footage seem to have a pretty high correlation.

          Using Python I created a notebook with formulas to predict gross profit using a monte carlo simulation. We
          input an average revenue and standard deviation, and then ran a simulation over 1,000 iterations. After
          creating that array, we generated an array of COGS using a random normal distribution ratio multiplied by the
          values in the revenue array. From there we were able to estimate the max, min, and standard deviation of
          profits, and then create a typical distribution curve.

          days in a year) over 1000 iterations to create an array for the different Forward Difference (S) plot points.

          ConnectOnCommute acts as an initiator for new, random conversations in real life with different people all
          around you in your community. Sometimes all we need is an invitation; users turn their 'social mode' on when
          they want to connect with others. As they're walking around, if another person in social mode is within range,
          both users receive a 'nudge' that includes the other person's name and a topic of interest to ask them about.
          Once both people click 'connect', a new connect-record is added to each users personal log.

          BootBook is an all inclusive platform for students and alumnus of coding bootcamps. The platform is a
          full-stack
          application that uses sequelizer and node.js in the back-end, and jquery, bootstrap, and css in the front-end
          for the UI design. BootBook allows the user to add new skills to their profile, and track their progress and
          learning. It also aims to foster innovation through collaboration with a feature that allows users to find
          other
          students and alumnus to work with based on the skillset they're looking for. In the future we'd like to
          develop a forum
          feature for students to ask and answer questions related to either code or career.
