          ConnectOnCommute acts as an initiator for new, random conversations in real life with different people all
          around you in your community. Sometimes all we need is an invitation; users turn their 'social mode' on when
          they want to connect with others. As they're walking around, if another person in social mode is within range,
          both users receive a 'nudge' that includes the other person's name and a topic of interest to ask them about.
          Once both people click 'connect', a new connect-record is added to each users personal log.

          BootBook is an all inclusive platform for students and alumnus of coding bootcamps. The platform is a
          full-stack
          application that uses sequelizer and node.js in the back-end, and jquery, bootstrap, and css in the front-end
          for the UI design. BootBook allows the user to add new skills to their profile, and track their progress and
          learning. It also aims to foster innovation through collaboration with a feature that allows users to find
          other
          students and alumnus to work with based on the skillset they're looking for. In the future we'd like to
          develop a forum
          feature for students to ask and answer questions related to either code or career.

          Bamazon is an interactive web application that simulates the process of making a purchase on many different
          e-commerce sites. Bamazon allowed me to sharpen my back-end development skills by creating a platform that
          brought together node.js and sql to manage a variety of administrative activities: inventory management, price
          calculations, and of course alerting the customer if the item they're seeking is no longer in stock.
