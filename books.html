        Andrew Yang makes the case for inspiring entrepreneurship and innovation in the United States. Throughout the
        book Yang explores the talent -
        or - "brain drain" that's causing some of the brightest minds to stear away from innovating and stay on a proven
        path to stability in finance or consulting.
        Yang makes the case that while those industries are important, they only work if they have companies to take on
        as clients. If everybody is consulting, there is nobody to consult.
        If everybody is looking to underwrite a company for an IPO, there is no one left to start a company to bring
        public. Yang's ideas at first glance seem to be
        unimportant in today's world, there are plenty of companies to consult and plenty of private companies to take
        public- however the data he provides shows us that a major
        talent crisis may not be something too far in the future.

        Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how
        to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time
        to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders
        can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting
        the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who
        overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to
        criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor.

        the NFL to the front lines of the civil rights movement, Duhigg presents a whole new understanding of human
        nature and its potential. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to
        exercising regularly, losing weight, being more productive, and achieving success is understanding how habits
        work. As Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our
